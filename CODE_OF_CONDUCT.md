- **Provide Constructive Feedback**: Offer feedback that supports improvement and development without personal criticism.
- **Respect Intellectual Property**: Give credit where due and honor contributions related to game features such as block management, economy system, Firebase saving/loading, and authentication.
- **Follow Project Conventions**: Adhere to coding and commit message conventions defined for this project to maintain clarity and consistency.

The maintainers will review reports carefully and take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy, productive project environment.
